# Natural Docs Default Language File, English (United States)
#
# To create a new language file, copy this one and rename it to replace
# "default" with the locale code in all lowercase, such as 
# "NaturalDocs.CLI.en-us.txt".  You can also omit the extension to have it apply
# to all locales in that language, such as "NaturalDocs.CLI.en.txt".  They
# inherit from each other, so anything not found in NaturalDocs.CLI.en-us.txt
# will be taken from NaturalDocs.CLI.en.txt, and if it's not in there, from 
# NaturalDocs.CLI.default.txt.

Folder Parameters:
------------------

 -p [folder]
