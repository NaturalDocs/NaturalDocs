# This is the Natural Docs languages file for this project.  If you change

# Ignored Extensions

# If you'd like to prevent certain file extensions from being scanned by

# These settings define the languages Natural Docs knows how to parse.  You
# can define your own here or override the settings of the existing ones.
# Note that all lists are space separated so that commas can be used as
# values.
#
# Language: [name]
# Alter Language: [name]
#    Defines a new language or alters an existing one.  Its name can use any
#    characters.  If any of the properties below have an add/replace form, you
#    must use that when using Alter Language.
#
#    The language Shebang Script is special.  It's entry is only used for
#    extensions, and files with those extensions have their shebang (#!) lines
#    read to determine the real language of the file.  Extensionless files are
#    always treated this way.
#
#    The language Text File is also special.  It's treated as one big comment
#    so you can put Natural Docs content in them without special symbols.
#
# Extensions: [extension] [extension] ...
# [Add/Replace] Extensions: [extension] [extension] ...
#    Defines the file extensions of the language's source files.
#
# Shebang Strings: [string] [string] ...
# [Add/Replace] Shebang Strings: [string] [string] ...
#    Defines a list of strings that can appear in the shebang (#!) line to
#    designate that it's part of the language.
#
# Simple Identifier: [name]
#    The name of the language using only the letters A to Z.  No spaces,
#    numbers, symbols, or Unicode allowed.  Defaults to the language name
#    minus any unacceptable characters.  This is used to generate things like
#    CSS class names.
#
# Aliases: [alias] [alias] ...
# [Add/Replace] Aliases: [alias] [alias] ...
#    Defines alternative names for the language that can be used to start a
#    code block.
#
#
# Properties for Basic Language Support Only
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# If you're adding your own language to Natural Docs you must define these.
#
# Line Comments: [symbol] [symbol] ...
#    Defines a space-separated list of symbols that are used for line comments,
#    if any.
#
# Block Comments: [opening sym] [closing sym] [opening sym] [closing sym] ...
#    Defines a space-separated list of symbol pairs that are used for block
#    comments, if any.
#
# Member Operator: [symbol]
#    Defines the default member operator symbol.  The default is a dot.
#
# Line Extender: [symbol]
#    Defines the symbol that allows a prototype to span multiple lines if
#    normally a line break would end it.
#
# Enum Values: [global|under type|under parent]
#    Defines how enum values are referenced.  The default is global.
#    global       - Values are always global, referenced as 'value'.
#    under type   - Values are under the enum type, referenced as
#                   'class.enum.value'.
#    under parent - Values are under the enum's parent, referenced as
#                   'class.value'.
#
# Case Sensitive: [yes|no]
#    Defines whether the language's identifiers are case sensitive.  The
#    default is yes.
#
# Block Comments Nest: [yes|no]
#    Defines whether the language's block comments can nest.  The default is
#    no.
#
# [Comment Type] Prototype Enders: [symbol] [symbol] ...
#    When defined, Natural Docs will attempt to get a prototype from the code
#    immediately following the comment type.  It stops when it reaches one of
#    these symbols.  Use \n for line breaks.
