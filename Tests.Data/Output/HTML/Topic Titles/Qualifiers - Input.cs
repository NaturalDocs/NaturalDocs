	Title: Qualifiers
	_______________________________________________________________________________

	Qualifiers are things like namespace levels and path folders that should be made a little less 
	prominent in titles in order to emphasize the ending class, function, or file name.  This is 
	especially important in languages like Java and C# where fully qualified names can be very 
	long (i.e. CodeClear.NaturalDocs.Engine.Output.Builders.HTML.)
	
	Zero width spaces (&#8203;) should also be inserted so long titles are allowed to wrap and 
	don't hurt the layout.  When separating the qualifiers from the ending symbol via a span tag,
	the zero width space must appear after the closing tag because Chrome won't break on it if
	it appears inside.

		The folders should be treated as qualifiers, but both dots in the file name should be ignored.
