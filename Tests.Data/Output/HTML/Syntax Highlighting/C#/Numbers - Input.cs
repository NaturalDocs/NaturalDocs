	Topic: Traps

		The fact that the hex value ends in E shouldn't make it think the following token is part of
		the number as an exponent.

		(code)

			int x = 0x000E+a;

			int x = 0x000e-1;

		(end)


		The minus sign should be part of the number for -1 but not for x-1.

		(code)

			int x = -1;

			int x = y-1;

			int x = y -1;

			int x = 1-1;

			int x = 1 -1;

			int x = (-1);

			int x = 1 + -1;

		(end)


		Digit separators can't start a number.

		(code)

			int x = _12;

		(end)


		Numbers appearing in other contexts shouldn't be mistaken for constants.

		(code)

			string a1_2_3 = "45";

		(end)
