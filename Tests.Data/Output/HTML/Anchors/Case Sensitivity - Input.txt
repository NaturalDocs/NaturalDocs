
Title: Case Sensitivity
_______________________________________________________________________________

	Whenever the algorithm changes the output HTML needs to be tested in every browser.  Every topic 
	has a long body so that you can easily check if the browser correctly navigates to it.

	Internet Explorer actually cannot handle case sensitive anchors, meaning it won't distinguish between
	#member and #Member.  However, we've successfully hacked around it in JavaScript.
