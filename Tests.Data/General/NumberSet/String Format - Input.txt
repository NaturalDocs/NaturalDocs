// Incorrect format
// --------------------------
// The stuff below may seem overly sensitive.  We can obviously interpret the input correctly without any data loss
// if we wanted to.  However, this isn't a format that should ever be written by hand.  It's only available to aid in
// debugging, testing, and storing number sets in text fields.  If the format is ever wrong in one of the ways below
// it means the object's internal state has broken.
