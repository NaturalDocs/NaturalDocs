/*
 * Class: CodeClear.NaturalDocs.Engine.Tests.Framework.BaseTestTypes.SourceToCommentsAndTopics
 * ____________________________________________________________________________
 *
 * A base class for automated tests where sample source files are loaded from a folder and converted to
 * <PossibleDocumentationComments> and <Topics>.  The results of <OutputOf()> are saved to files and
 * compared to other files containing the expected result.
 *
 *	The benefit of this approach is that you never have to hand code the output.  You can run the tests without
 *	an expected output file, look over the actual output file, and if it's acceptable rename it to become the
 * expected output file.
 *
 * Deriving a Test Type:
 *
 *		- Derive a class in the TestTypes namespace.
 *
 *		- Define <OutputOf()> to convert some facet of the <Topics> and <PossibleDocumentationComments> to
 *		  string output.
 *
 *
 * Input and Output Files:
 *
 *		- All files in the test folder in the format "[Test Name] - Input.[extension]" will be tested when NUnit runs.
 *
 *		- A corresponding file "[Test Name] - Actual Output.txt" will be created for each one.
 *
 *		- If it matches the contents of the file "[Test Name] - Expected Output.txt", the test will pass.  If it doesn't,
 *		  that file doesn't exist, or an exception was thrown, the test will fail.

		 *
		 * This function should not return null or an empty string as part of a successful test.  Doing so will cause the
		 * test to fail.  If a test is supposed to generated no output, return a string such as "test successful" instead.
