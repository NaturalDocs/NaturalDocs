Format: 2.0 (Development Release 11-04-2012)

# This is the Natural Docs topics file for this project.  If you change anything
# here, it will apply to THIS PROJECT ONLY.  You can edit the version in
# Natural Docs' Config folder to make the changes apply to all projects, but
# it's recommended that you edit this version instead.


# Ignored Keywords
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If you'd like to prevent keywords from being recognized by Natural Docs,
# you can do it like this:
#
# Ignore Keywords:
#    [keyword]
#    [keyword]
#    ...


# Tags
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Tags allow you to create documentation that only includes topics marked
# with that tag.  If you'd like to define your own tags, you can do it like
# this:
#
# Tags:
#    [tag]
#    [tag]
#    ...


# Topic Types
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Each Natural Docs topic has a corresponding type which determine things
# like how they are indexed.  You can define your own here or override the
# settings of the existing ones.
#
# Topic Type: [name]
# Alter Topic Type: [name]
#    Creates a new topic type or changes an existing one.
#
# Display Name: [name]
# Plural Display Name: [name]
#    The singular and plural name of the topic type as it should appear in the
#    output.
#
# Simple Identifier: [name]
#    The name of the topic type using only the letters A to Z.  No spaces,
#    numbers, symbols, or Unicode allowed.  Defaults to the topic type name
#    minus any unacceptable characters.  This is used to generate things like
#    CSS class names.
#
# Index: [yes|no|with [topic type]]
#    Whether an index should be generated for the topic type.  Defaults to
#    yes.  If "with [topic type]" is specified, the type is indexed but only
#    as part of the other topic type's index.
#
# Scope: [normal|start|end|always global]
#    How the topic affects scope.  Defaults to normal.
#    normal        - The topic stays within the current scope.
#    start         - The topic starts a new scope for all the topics beneath
#                    it, like class topics.
#    end           - The topic resets the scope back to global for all the
#                    topics beneath it, like section topics.
#    always global - The topic is defined as a global symbol, but does not
#                    change the scope for any other topics.
#
# Flags: [flag], [flag], ...
#    A combination of settings that apply to the topic type.
#    Code, File, or Documentation
#        Whether it's used to describe a code element, a file, or is a
#        standalone documentation comment.  Defaults to Code.
#    Variable Type
#        Whether it describes a code element that can be used as a variable's
#        type.
#    Class Hierarchy or Database Hierarchy
#        Whether it describes a code element that should be included in the
#        class or database hierarchy.  Requires Scope: Start.
#    Enum
#        Whether it describes an enum.
#
# Break Lists: [yes|no]
#    Whether list topics should be broken into individual topics in the
#    output.  Defaults to no.
#
# Keywords:
#    [keyword]
#    [keyword], [plural keyword]
#    ...
#    A list of the topic type's keywords.  Each line after the heading is the
#    keyword and optionally its plural form for list topics.  You can reuse
#    existing keywords to change their definition.  When using
#    "Alter Topic Type", these keywords are added to the existing ones rather
#    than replacing them.
