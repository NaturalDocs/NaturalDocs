	The formatting on these is always going to be less than ideal, we just need to make sure the code handles
	them at least passably.

	It's tempting to fade them out like we do for default values, and you can do that by setting the opacity of
	PTypeSuffix, but it's undesirable with template<int> and array[] which are the far more common cases.

	C and D mean "constant pointer to a constant int".
