# Input
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Source Folder: ..


# This is where you specify what files and folders Natural Docs should be
# scanning.  If you use any of these options on the command line, this entire
# section is ignored except for names and numbers.
#
# All paths are relative to the project folder, which lets this file remain
# portable across computers and not cause problems in version control systems.
# You can enter absolute paths and they will be converted automatically.
#
# Source Folder: [path]
#    Name: [name]
#
#    Specifies a folder which will be searched for source files.  If you have
#    more than one, add the Name property to set how it will show up in the
#    menu.
#
# Image Folder: [path]
#    Specifies a folder which will be searched for image files.


# Filtering
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If there are any subfolders of the input folders that you would like Natural
# Docs to ignore, they can be specified here.  If you use any of these options
# on the command line, this entire section is ignored.
#
# Ignore Source Folder: [path]
#    Tells Natural Docs to skip this folder when scanning files.
#
# Ignore Source Folder Pattern: [pattern]
#    Tells Natural Docs to skip all folders which match this pattern when
#    scanning files.  ? matches a single character, * matches zero or more
#    characters.  It applies to the entire folder name, so "cli" will not
#    match "client", although "cli*" will.


# Output
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

HTML Output Folder: ..\ND Temp\HTML Output


# This is where you specify what kind of documentation you want Natural Docs
# to build and where it should be put.  If you use any of these options on the
# command line, this entire section is ignored except for secondary settings.
#
# All paths are relative to the project folder, which lets this file remain
# portable across computers and not cause problems in version control systems.
# You can enter absolute paths and they will be converted automatically.
#
# You can override any of the project information settings under each entry,
# so if you have multiple output folders you can give them each different
# styles or subtitles.
#
# HTML Output Folder: [path]
#    [Project Information]
#
#    Generates HTML documentation in the specified folder.
#
# XML Output Folder: [path]
#    [Project Information]
#

# command line override the settings here.
