_______________________________________________________________________________

The presence of Test Folder.txt in a folder indicates that it is a folder of "expected output"-based tests.

Alternative File Names:

	The file can also have one of these names, which is useful if you want it to appear at the top of a sorted file list:

	- - Test Folder.txt
	- ~ Test Folder.txt
	- .Test Folder.txt


Group: Test File Names
_______________________________________________________________________________

	Tests are files with names in the format "[test name] - Input.[ext]".  The part prior to " - Input" can be anything, as can the
	file extension, so a test can be named "Prototype Parsing - Input.cs".

	After the tests are run, a file called "[test name] - Actual Output.txt" will be created in the same folder as the test file, so
	"Prototype Parsing - Actual Output.txt" in our example.

	The expected test results are stored in "[test name] - Expected Output.txt".  If they match the actual output, the test passes.
	If the expected output file doesn't exist or the contents don't match, the test fails.  This design allows file comparison programs
	to compare the expected output to the actual output to see what changed.  It also allows the actual output file to just be saved
	as the expected output file if everything is correct.  When creating new tests you don't have to create an expected output file by
	hand, you can just run the test without one and check the contents of the actual output file that was generated, then resave it.

	Topic: Format

		> Format: [version]

		Like other Natural Docs configuration files, the first content line must be a Format line that specifies what version it was written
		for.


	Topic: Test Type

		> Test Type: [type]

		The test to be run on each input file in the current folder.  This must exist in each configuration file.  You cannot have more
		than one type of test per folder, though subfolders can have different tests.


	Topic: Engine Config

		> Engine Config: [path]

		This can be used to set the project configuration folder Natural Docs should use.  This is primarily to configure <Languages.txt>,
		<Comments.txt>, and any custom styles.  Most settings in <Project.txt> will be overridden or ignored, and some of them can be
		set with the below properties.  Optional.


	Topic: Keep HTML

		> Keep HTML: [yes/no]

		If HTML output is built as part of the test, whether it should be kept so that it can be manually opened and inspected afterwards.
		If yes it will be stored in a "HTML Output" subfolder.  If not it will be deleted with the other temporary data generated.  Optional,
		defaults to no.


	Topic: Title

		> Title: [text]

		If <Keep HTML> is true, this can be used to set the title of the HTML output.  Optional.


	Topic: Subtitle

		> Subtitle: [text]

		If <Keep HTML> is true, this can be used to set the subtitle of the HTML output.  Optional.


	Topic: Style

		> Style: [name]

		If <Keep HTML> is true, this can be used to set the style of the HTML output.  Optional.


	Topic: Auto-Group

		> Auto-Group: [yes/no]

		Whether automatic grouping is turned on or off.  It is normally turned off to prevent unnecessary topics from appearing in the
		output, but can be turned on to test the automatic grouping code itself.  Optional, defaults to no.


	Topic: Documented Only

		> Documented Only: [yes/no]

		Whether only documented code elements should appear in the output.  Optional, defaults to no.
