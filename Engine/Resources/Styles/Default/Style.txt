# This is a configuration file for a Natural Docs HTML output style.


# Inheritance
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Inherit: DefaultJS


# You can inherit the settings of another style like this:
#
# Inherit: [style]
#
# All of its settings will be applied before yours.  You can add this line
# multiple times to inherit more than one style.
#
# If you just want to make some changes to the default style, inherit Default.
# If you're building your own page design from scratch but want to keep the
# default JavaScript functions, inherit DefaultJS.  This will include the code
# but not the CSS or images.


# Linked Files
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Link: Default.css


# You can link .css, .js, and .json files to the output like this:
#
# Link: [file]
# Frame Link: [file]
# Content Link: [file]
# Home Link: [file]
#
# These files will be added to the generated output via link or script tags.
#
# You can limit JavaScript files to just to the frame page, which handles the
# header, footer, menu, summary, and search, or to content pages, which is the
# documentation in the rightmost panel, or to the home page.  If you do not
# specify a page type they will be linked to every page.  CSS files can only
# be linked to every page.
#
# All files will be copied to the output folder even if you don't link them,
# but they will not be added to the pages automatically.


# OnLoad
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Frame OnLoad: NDThemes.SetAvailableThemes([ ["$Locale{Theme.Light}", "Light"], ["$Locale{Theme.Dark}", "Dark"], ["$Locale{Theme.Black}", "Black"], ["$Locale{Theme.AutoLightDark}", "Auto:Light/Dark"], ["$Locale{Theme.AutoLightBlack}", "Auto:Light/Black"] ]);


# You can add code to the page's OnLoad handler like this:
#
# OnLoad: [statement]
# Frame OnLoad: [statement]
# Content OnLoad: [statement]
# Home OnLoad: [statement]
#
# You can limit it to just to the frame page, which handles the header,
# footer, menu, summary, and search, or to content pages, which is the
# documentation in the rightmost panel, or to the home page.  If you do not
# specify a page type it will be added to every page.
#
# The OnLoad statement is limited to a single line.  If you have a lot of code
# it's recommended that you make it a function in a separate .js file, link
# that file, and then call the function from this statement rather than trying
# to cram it all on this line.


# Home Page
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# You can choose a custom HTML file to serve as the home page for the output
# like this:
#
# Home Page: [file]
#
# It will appear in the content area of the documentation's home page,
# separate from the header and side menu which will both still be visible.
# The file you choose must have a .html extension.
#
# If this is defined, none of the OnLoad or Link properties will have any
# effect on it.  You must add those things directly to the HTML file if
# they're needed.
#
# The HTML file may contain these strings which will be replaced by your
# project information.  They will have entity substitutions made for <, >, &,
# and " characters so they're safe to place directly in the HTML or inside
# double-quoted JavaScript strings.
