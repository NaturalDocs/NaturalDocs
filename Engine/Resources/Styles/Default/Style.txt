# This is a configuration file for a Natural Docs HTML output style.


# Inheritance
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Inherit: DefaultJS


# You can inherit the settings of another style like this:
#
# Inherit: [style]
#
# All of its settings will be applied before yours.  You can add this line
# multiple times to inherit more than one style.
#
# If you just want to make some changes to the default style, inherit Default.
# If you're building your own page design from scratch but want to keep the
# default JavaScript functions, inherit DefaultJS.  This will include the code
# but not the CSS or images.


# Linked Files
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Link: Default.css


# You can link .css, .js, and .json files to the output like this:
#
# Link: [file]
# Frame Link: [file]
# Content Link: [file]
#
# These files will be added to the generated output via link or script tags.
#
# You can limit them to just to the frame page, which handles the header,
# footer, menu, and summary, or to content pages, which is the documentation
# in the rightmost panel.  If you do not specify a page type, they will be
# linked to every page.
#
# All files will be copied to the output folder even if you don't link them,
# but they will not be added to the pages automatically.


# OnLoad
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# You can add code to the page's OnLoad handler like this:
#
# OnLoad: [statement]
# Frame OnLoad: [statement]
# Content OnLoad: [statement]
#
# You can limit it to just to the frame page, which handles the header,
# footer, menu, and summary, or to content pages, which is the documentation
# in the rightmost panel.  If you do not specify a page type, it will be added
# to every page.
#
# The OnLoad statement is limited to a single line.  If you have a lot of code
# it's recommended that you make it a function in a separate .js file, link
# that file, and then call the function from this statement rather than trying
# to cram it all on this line.
