# Natural Docs Default Language File, English (United States)
#
# To create a new language file, copy this one and rename it to replace
# "default" with the locale code in all lowercase, such as 
# "NaturalDocs.Engine.en-us.txt".  You can also omit the extension to have it
# apply to all locales in that language, such as "NaturalDocs.Engine.en.txt".
# They inherit from each other, so anything not found in 
# NaturalDocs.Engine.en-us.txt will be taken from NaturalDocs.Engine.en.txt,
# and if it's not in there, from NaturalDocs.Engine.default.txt.

# Member Operator: [symbol]
#    Defines the default member operator symbol.  The default is a dot.

# [Topic Type] Prototype Enders: [symbol] [symbol] ...

# Alter Language: [name]

#    always treated this way.
#
#    The language Text File is also special.  It's treated as one big comment
#    so you can put Natural Docs content in them without special symbols.  Also,

#    copy those settings from the language that is used most in the source tree.
