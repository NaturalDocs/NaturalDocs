Topic: WorkOn Functions
	
	Functions prefixed with "WorkOn" are meant for worker thread processing, such as WorkOnAddingAllFiles().  They have 
	<CancelDelegate> parameters so they can be interrupted, and are designed so that more than one thread can call the
	function and they will split the workload between them.  However, if the multithreading model is not desired, they can
	be called from a single thread with <Delegates.NeverCancel> and it will behave as a normal function.


Topic: Dependency Comments

	Sometimes functions depend on assumed behaviors in other functions or implementation details that may not be obvious 
	from 	the outside.  Normally you would want to avoid this but sometimes it may be important for efficiency.  When this 
	happens, *both* functions *must* contain a dependency comment:

	> void FunctionA ()
	>    {
	>    // DEPENDENCY: FunctionB() assumes this function does X so that it can do Y.
	>    ...
	>    }
	>
	> void FunctionB ()
	>    {
	>    // DEPENDENCY: This assumes FunctionA() does X so that we can do Y.
	>    ...
	>    }

	Each comment *must* explicitly name the other functions involved and explain the behavior.  This is so when someone 
	changes one of the functions, it's obvious which other functions depend on the behavior, what that behavior is, and why.
	Then the programmer won't inadvertantly change that behavior without being aware of the side effects, and if it needs to 
	be changed anyway they can update the dependent functions.  These comments also start with "DEPENDENCY:" by convention 
	to make them stand out more and and be easier to search for.
