
Title: File Processing
_______________________________________________________________________________

This is a very broad overview and doesn't contain all the necessary details of the process.  Rather, use it as a
framework to get oriented with the code and then delve into the specific areas you need.


Topic: Setup

	File sources are specified by <Project.txt> and/or the command line as managed by <Config.Manager>.
	<Config.Manager.Start()> then converts each one into a <Files.FileSource> to be managed by <Files.Manager>.
	
	<Files.Manager.Start()> loads the previous state of all the source files from <Files.nd> and now holds all the file 
	names and IDs as of the last run.
	

Topic: Initial Scan

	Client code calls <Files.Manager.CreateAdderProcess()> and executes it, which iterates through every file and 
	adds it to <Files.Manager>.  If the file was previously unknown or the timestamp has changed, the file is new or 
	changed.
	
	After this process, the client code calls <Files.Manager.DeleteFilesNotReAdded()> to find which ones were deleted
	and mark them as such.
	
	
Topic: Parsing

	The client calls <Files.Manager.CreateChangeProcessor()> and executes it.  Every deleted file will have its 
	information deleted from the database.  Every new or changed file will have its language determined by 
	<Languages.Manager>, be loaded from disk, be run through the appropriate <Languages.Language.Parse()> function,
	have the results compared to the database, and then the database will be updated.

	
Topic: Detecting Changes

	The output targets do not monitor <Files.Manager> to detect changes.  Rather, they implement 
	<CodeDB.IChangeWatcher> and add themselves to <CodeDB.Manager> before change processing starts.  When
	<Files.Manager> updates the database to reflect changes in the source files, <CodeDB.Manager> will notify all its 
	watchers of the net effect through functions like <CodeDB.IChangeWatcher.OnAddTopic()>.
	
	
Topic: Building Output

	Output targets were also created by <Config.Manager>.  During the parsing pass, they collect the CodeDB changes as 
	lists of files that need to be rebuilt.  They don't need to store every bit of information, such as the ID of every topic
	that was changed, but the net effect it has on the building stage.  For example, if a new topic was added, they only
	need to store the IDs of the source and class files that need to be updated because of it.

	After all parsing is done, client code calls <Output.Manager.CreateBuilderProcess()> and executes it.  This goes through
	all the targets so they can recreate the output files that were affected by the changes they observed.  They can retrieve the 
	updated topics from <CodeDB.Manager> which is why it was unnecessary to store every detail of every change.
