
Database Table: CodeDB.Contexts
_______________________________________________________________________________

The table that contains all of the contexts used by <Topics> and <Links>.

These are stored in a separate table and managed with IDs instead of being stored inline with the <Topics> and
<Links> because there would be a lot of data duplication otherwise.  In languages like C# there may be a lot of
"use" statements in effect for a file.  We wouldn't want this non-trivial string to be duplicated for every topic and
link in that file because it would waste a lot of memory.
