Database Column: SymbolDefinitionNumber

	--- Prototype ---
		SymbolDefinitionNumber INTEGER NOT NULL
	-----------------

	Every unique <Symbol> defined in a file is given a number, the first one being one.  Every duplicate definition
	of the same symbol will receive an incremented number based on the source file order.


Database Column: ClassID

	--- Prototype ---
		ClassID INTEGER NOT NULL
	-----------------

	The ID of the class this topic creates or is a member of, or zero if it's global.


Database Column: DefinesClass

	--- Prototype ---
		DefinesClass INTEGER NOT NULL
	-----------------

	Whether this topic defines its <ClassID> as opposed to just being a member, stored as 1 or 0.


Database Column: IsList

	--- Prototype ---
		IsList INTEGER NOT NULL
	-----------------

	Whether this is a list topic, stored as 1 or 0.  This will not be set for enum topics, though it could be set for a
	list of enums.

	-----------------

	Whether this topic is embedded in a prior topic, stored as 1 or 0.  This is used for members of list topics or enums.
	Entries that appear in definition lists within these topics will get their own record to allow for linking, but they will not 
	appear in the output because they are already covered by the parent.


Database Column: EndingSymbol

	--- Prototype ---
		EndingSymbol TEXT NOT NULL
	-----------------
	
	The <Symbols.EndingSymbol> that's derived from <Symbol>.

		CommentTypeID INTEGER NOT NULL
	-----------------
	
	The ID of the topic's type, as managed by <CodeClear.NaturalDocs.Engine.CommentTypes.Manager>.
	
	
Database Column: DeclaredAccessLevel

	--- Prototype ---
		DeclaredAccessLevel INTEGER NOT NULL
	-----------------
	
	The declared access level of the topic, such as public or protected.  The value is managed by 
	<CodeClear.NaturalDocs.Engine.Languages.AccessLevel>.
	
	
Database Column: EffectiveAccessLevel

	--- Prototype ---
		EffectiveAccessLevel INTEGER NOT NULL
	-----------------
	
	The effective access level of the topic, such as public or protected.  The value is managed by 
	<CodeClear.NaturalDocs.Engine.Languages.AccessLevel>.
	
	
Database Column: Tags

	--- Prototype ---
		Tags TEXT
	-----------------
	
	A number set of all the tags applied to this topic, as managed by <CodeClear.NaturalDocs.Engine.CommentTypes.Manager>.

		FileID INTEGER NOT NULL
	-----------------
	
	The ID of the file it appears in, as managed by <CodeClear.NaturalDocs.Engine.Files.Manager>.


Database Column: FilePosition

	--- Prototype ---
		FilePosition INTEGER NOT NULL
	-----------------

	The relative position of the topic within the file.  The first one will be one and all following topics will have
	higher numbers.  This is necessary to keep the order consistent because it may not be able to be determined
	from <CommentLineNumber> and <CodeLineNumber>.
	

Database Column: CommentLineNumber

	--- Prototype ---
		CommentLineNumber INTEGER NOT NULL
	-----------------

		LanguageID INTEGER NOT NULL
	-----------------
	
	The ID of the topic's language, as managed by <CodeClear.NaturalDocs.Engine.Languages.Manager>.  If the
	file it appears in is a container file (such as .cgi or .asp) the ID will be for the embedded language, not the
	container.
	
	
Database Column: PrototypeContextID

	--- Prototype ---
		PrototypeContextID INTEGER NOT NULL
	-----------------
	
	The ID of the context any prototype links should appear in, or zero for the global context.
	
	
Database Column: BodyContextID

	--- Prototype ---
		CREATE INDEX TopicsByFile ON Topics (FileID, FilePosition)
