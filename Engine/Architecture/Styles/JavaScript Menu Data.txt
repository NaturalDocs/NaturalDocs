
Title: JavaScript Menu Data
_______________________________________________________________________________

	Natural Docs generates the menu as JavaScript files located in the menu subfolder of the output folder.  These files are not
	linked to the HTML by default so any style files that need them are responsible for loading them.  If you include the DefaultJS
	style this will be handled by <NDMenu>.


	Topic: Tab Information

		Information about which tabs are available in the menu is stored in [Output Folder]\menu\tabs.js.  The file contains a call to
		the function NDMenu.OnTabsLoaded() that looks like this:

		> NDMenu.OnTabsLoaded([
		>    [ "File", "Files", "File:Folder/", "files.js" ],
		>    [ "Class", "Classes", undefined, "classes.js" ]
		>    ]);

		The only parameter is an array of the tabs that are present.  Each entry is an array in this format:

		> [ "Type", "HTML Title", "Hash Path", "FileWithContents.js" ]
		> [ "Type", ["HTML Title", "HTML Title 2", "HTML Title 3"], "Hash Path", "FileWithContents.js" ]

		The first member is a string representing the type of tab it is.  If you're using the DefaultJS style, this will map directly to
		<NDLocation.type> so you can tell which one should be selected for a given location.  It will be safe to include as part of a
		CSS name and it will stay consistent across languages.

		The second member is the title in HTML, and it may be a string or an array of strings.  If it's an array of strings, that means 
		the menu has been condensed and multiple layers of containers have been combined into it.
		
		The third member is the hash path, which may be undefined.  If the menu was condensed containers that had hash paths
		may have been combined with the root container, giving the tab a hash path.
		
		The fourth member is the file which contains the data for that particular tab.  It's stored in the menu subfolder of the output 
		folder, just like tabs.js.


	Topic: Menu Sections

		The menu data is stored in multiple files which can have names like files2.js or classes.js.  When executed, they call
		NDMenu.OnSectionLoaded(), passing the file name and part of the menu it stores as an array of entries.  Each entry is itself 
		an array whose first value is its type.

		> NDMenu.OnSectionLoaded( "files2.js", [ ... ] );
		
		Target Entries:
		
			> [1, "HTML Title", "Hash Path"]
			> [1, "HTML Title"]
			
			Target entries represent a content page, such as a source file or class.  The first value is always 1, and the second
			value is the title in HTML.
			
			The third value is the hash path and is optional.  If it isn't specified, that means it's the same as the title.  The hash 
			path only represents the last portion of the path, such as "SourceFile.cs" in "File:Folder/Folder/SourceFile.cs", so to 
			get the full path you must concatenate it to its container's hash path.
			
		Container Entries:
		
			> [2, "HTML Title", "Partial Hash Path", [ members ]]
			> [2, "HTML Title", "Partial Hash Path", "MenuDataFileName.js" ]
			> [2, ["HTML Title", "HTML Title 2", "HTML Title 3"], "Partial Hash Path", [ members ]]
			> [2, ["HTML Title", "HTML Title 2", "HTML Title 3"], "Partial Hash Path", "MenuDataFileName.js"]
	
			Container entries represent another layer of the menu, such as a file folder.  The first value is always 2.
			
			The second value is the title in HTML, and it may be a string or an array of strings.  If it's an array of strings, that means 
			the menu has been condensed and multiple layers of containers have been combined into one.
			
			The third value is the hash path, which is the absolute path of everything up to the last element, such as "File:Path/Path/" 
			or "CSharpClass:Namespace.Namespace.".  It will never be relative so you don't have to climb up the hierarchy to 
			construct the full path.  It includes the trailing separator symbol so the target hash path can be concatenated directly 
			on to it.
			
			The fourth value is its members and they may be specified inline as an array or be a string representing the data file they
			are stored in.  It will not include a path.
