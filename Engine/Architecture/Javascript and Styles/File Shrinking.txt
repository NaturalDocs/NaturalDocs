
Title: File Shrinking
_______________________________________________________________________________

	JavaScript and CSS style files are shrunk in the generated output.  All unnecessary whitespace and comments are removed.
	This results in a smaller file sizes and it also lets you document your files heavily without worrying about how it will affect the
	output.

	As this includes line breaks, you have to be diligent about using semicolons in JavaScript.  For example, you must make sure 
	all functions defined this way have a semicolon after the closing brace:

	> this.FunctionName = function ()
	>    {
	>    ...
	>    };

	It's technically an assignment statement, not a declaration, so it needs to be finished with a semicolon.  This won't cause
	an error in JavaScript that isn't shrunk because the semicolon would be implied by the line break, but the shrunk JavaScript
	won't have line breaks.


	Topic: Turning Off Shrinking and Debugging

		You can turn off file shrinking with the --dont-shrink-files command line option.  This will allow you to step through the
		code in the output with browser's developer tools.  However, file shrinking is on by default so if other people are going
		to be using your files you need to make sure they work shrunk too.  Also, the default Natural Docs JavaScript is heavily
		commented so you'll be increasing their output file sizes considerably by turning it off.


	Topic: Including Comments in Shrunken Files

		Normally comments are removed during shrinking, but if there's some copyright and licensing information you want to keep in 
		there, put them in a comment under the heading "Include in output:".

		> /* Include in output:
		>  * Copyright (C) 2013 Me
		>  */

		Only the text from the following line to the end of the comment will be included so you can have other information above it.  If
		you include Natural Docs comments in your file and don't want this included in that documentation, put it in a separate comment.
