
Title: JavaScript Summary Data
_______________________________________________________________________________

	Each content file will also have a JavaScript summary file.  It's in the same folder and has the same file name, only ending 
	with -Summary.js instead of .html.  So for SourceFile-cs.html the summary file would be SourceFile-cs-Summary.js.
		

	Topic: Page Title
		
		When executed, it will pass the source file's title to <NDFramePage.OnPageTitleLoaded()> along with the hash path it's
		for.

		> NDFramePage.OnPageTitleLoaded("File:Folder/Folder/SourceFile.cs","Page Title");
			

	Topic: Summary
		
		When executed, it will also pass the source file's summary to <NDSummary.OnSummaryLoaded()> along with the hash
		path it's for.

		> NDSummary.OnSummaryLoaded("File:Folder/Folder/SourceFile.cs",
		>    [["Language HTML Name","LanguageSimpleID"]],
		>
		>    [["Comment Type HTML Name","CommentTypeSimpleID"],
		>     ["Comment Type 2 HTML Name","CommentType2SimpleID"]],
		>
		>    [[1234,0,0,"Topic HTML Name","TopicHashSymbol"],
		>     [1235,0,1,"Topic 2 HTML Name","Topic2HashSymbol"],
		>     [1236,0,1,,"Topic3HashSymbol"]]
		>    );
		
		Languages:

			The first parameter is is an array of the languages used in the summary.  They appear in the order in which they should
			appear in the output.  Each language is an array with these members:
			
			nameHTML - The name of the language in HTML.
			simpleIdentifier - A simplified version of the name which can be used in CSS classes.
		
		Comment Types:

			The second parameter is an array of the comment types used in the summary.  They appear in the order in which they should
			appear in the output.  Each comment type is an array with these members:
			
			pluralNameHTML - The plural name of the comment type in HTML.
			simpleIdentifier - A simplified version of the name which can be used in CSS classes.
		
		Summary Entries:

			The third parameter is an array of summary entries, each of which is an array with these members:
			
			topicID - A numeric ID for the topic, unique across the whole project.
			languageIndex - The topic's language as an index into the languages array.
			commentTypeIndex - The comment type as an index into the comment types array.
			nameHTML - The name of the topic in HTML.  This will be undefined for embedded topics.
			symbol - The topic's symbol in the hash path.  May be undefined if you should use the file's hash path alone.

			What is an embedded topic?  One that appears within another topic, such as a list topic or an enumeration's members.
			The names are undefined so they should not be displayed in the summary's generated HTML.  However, they are included
			in the summary data anyway because a complete list of defined topics may be needed to help navigation.
