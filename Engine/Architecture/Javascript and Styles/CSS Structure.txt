
Title: CSS Structure

	Notation:

	This page uses a very simplified notation so you can quickly scan through the CSS classes.

	- Uppercase tags represent CSS classes, so <CBody> is a HTML element with CBody applied.
	  Style with ".CBody".

	- Lowercase tags represent HTML elements, so <html NDPage> is the root html element with NDPage
	  applied.  Style with "html.NDPage" or just ".NDPage".

		- Most tags will not specify an element type so you should not rely on them being a particular
		  type.

	- Multiple tags are multiple CSS classes applied to the same element, so <html NDPage NDContentPage>
	  is the html element with both NDPage and NDContentPage applied.  Style with "html.NDPage.NDContentPage",
	  ".NDPage.NDContentPage", or just ".NDContentPage".

	- Hash symbols on tags represent HTML IDs, so <#NDHeader> is a HTML element with NDHeader as
	  the ID.  Style with "#NDHeader".

	- Question marks after tags means it may or may not appear, so <#NDMenuSizer Dragging?> means
	  the element may or may not have the CSS class Dragging applied, in this case because it only appears
	  while it's actively being dragged.

	- data-MyProperty="..." means the HTML element will have a data attribute of that name, such as
	  <div data-Index="4">.

	Hopefully everything else should be self-explanitory.

----------

	[ThemeName]:

		If there are one or more themes defined in <NDThemes>, the ID of the selected theme will be applied to the root
		html element as a CSS class with "Theme" appended, such as ID "Light" becoming "LightTheme".  The CSS classes
		for the themes in the default style are "LightTheme", "DarkTheme", and "BlackTheme".

		You can override which themes available by calling <NDFramePage.SetThemes()> from a Frame OnLoad statement
		in <Style.txt>.  You can also force it to be a particular one by calling <NDFramePage.ForceTheme(ID)>, or call
		<NDFramePage.DisableThemes()> to turn them off altogether.  When disabled there will be no theme CSS class
		added, but when forced it will be the one for the theme you forced.



Topic: Menu
_______________________________________________________________________________

Only the topmost #NDMenu tag is in the generated HTML.  The remaining structure is generated by the <NDMenu>
JavaScript class included in the DefaultJS style.  Other styles may or may not use this class.

--- text ---

	<#NDMenu>

		<#MTabBar>

			<a MTab #M[Type]Tab Selected? Wide/Narrow?>
				<MTabIcon></MTabIcon>
				<MTabTitle>Title</MTabTitle>
			</a MTab>

		</#MTabBar>

		<#MContent>

			<MTabAsFolder #M[Type]Tab MEntry>
				<MTabIcon></MTabIcon>
				<MTabTitle>Title</MTabTitle>
			</MTabAsFolder>

			<MFolder MEntry Parent Empty? Selected?>
				Name
			</MFolder>

			<MFile MEntry TopLevel? Selected?>
				Name
			</MFile>

			<MFolder MEntry Child TopLevel?>
				<MFolderIcon></MFolderIcon>
				Name
			</MFolder>

			<MLoadingNotice>
			</MLoadingNotice>

		</#MContent>
	</#NDMenu>

----------

	If there's nothing selected, not even a tab, there will be no MTabBar.  Instead the tabs will appear as MTabAsFolder
	entries so they can be formatted more like regular menu entries.

	If a tab is selected there will be a MTabBar followed by a list of MFile and MFolder entries representing the root level
	contents of that tab.  They will all have the TopLevel attribute applied.

	Once a folder is selected there will be a MTabBar followed by a stack of parent MFolders representing the path from
	the tab to the selected folder, then followed by the MFile and MFolder entries that are the contents of that folder.

	Most entries will be "a" tags, though they may be div tags if they don't need to serve as a link, such as empty and
	selected folders.  Use the Parent, Child, and Selected classes to distinguish between types of folder entries, such as
	.MFolder.Child.

	At any point the sequence above can be truncated with a MLoadingNotice tab if the menu is not completely loaded yet.



Topic: Summary
_______________________________________________________________________________

Only the topmost #NDSummary tag is in the generated HTML.  The remaining structure is generated by the <NDSummary>
JavaScript class included in the DefaultJS style.  Other styles may or may not use this class.

Topic: Prototype
_______________________________________________________________________________


Frame:

	--- text ---

	<NDPrototype #NDPrototype[ID] WideForm/NarrowForm?>

		section
		section
		...

	</NDPrototype #NDPrototype[ID] WideForm/NarrowForm?>

	----------

	Prototypes are a frame and then a series of sections within it.  The sections are formatted differently depending on their type.

	The prototype will only have a WideForm or NarrowForm attribute if it contains a parameter section.


Plain Section:

	--- text ---

	<PSection PPlainSection>

		content

	</PSection PPlainSection>

	----------


Parameter Section:

	--- text ---

	<PSection PParameterSection CStyle/PascalStyle>
		<PParameterCells data-WideColumnCount="..." data-NarrowColumnCount="...">

			<P[CellType] data-WideGridArea="..." data-NarrowGridArea="..." [Formatting Properties]?>

				content

			</P[CellType] data-WideGridArea="..." data-NarrowGridArea="..." [Formatting Properties]?>

			<P[CellType]>...
			<P[CellType]>...
			...

			<PParameterCells Nested
				data-WideColumnCount="..." data-NarrowColumnCount="..."
				data-WideGridArea="..." data-NarrowGridArea="...">

				<P[CellType]>...
				<P[CellType]>...
				...

			</PParameterCells Nested>

		</PParameterCells>
	</PSection PParameterSection CStyle/PascalStyle>

	----------

	Parameter sections are formatted using a CSS grid layout.  Inside each section is a series of cells which have
	data-WideGridArea and data-NarrowGridArea values that define their grid positions in the wide and narrow
	prototype layouts.  data-WideGridArea will be applied by default via the style="" attribute, but they can be
	switched between using JavaScript.  The parent PParameterCells object will also have a count of the total
	number of columns in the data-WideColumnCount and data-NarrowColumnCount properties.

	It's possible to have an nested set of parameter cells.  This is used when a section has two sets of parameters
	and you want the before parameters parts to line up but not the parameters within them.  For example:

	--- Code
	int Indexer [unsigned int x,
	                      int y ]
	           { get,
	             set  }
	---


	P[CellType]:

		PBeforeParameters - The section appearing before the first parameter, including the opening parameter
									   symbol, if any.
		PAfterParameters - The section appearing after the last parameter, including the closing parameter symobl,
									if any.

		POpeningDecorator - For Tcl prototypes, a separate column for opening parameter decorators, such as { in
									   {a 12}.
 		PModifierQualifier - For C-style prototypes, a separate column for modifiers and qualifiers.
		PType - The parameter type.  For C-style prototypes this will only be the last word.  For Pascal-style
						prototypes this will be the entire symbol.
		PTypeNameSeparator - For Pascal-style prototypes, the symbol separating the name from the type.
		PSymbols - Symbols before a parameter name that should be formatted with the name, such as * and &.
		PName - The parameter name.
		PDefaultValueSeparator - If present, the symbol for assigning a default value like = or :=.
		PDefaultValue - The default value.
		PPropertyValueSeparator - If present, the symbol for assigning a value to a property like = or :.
		PPropertyValue - The property value, such as could appear in Java annotations.
		PClosingDecorator - For Tcl prototypes, a separate column for opening parameter decorators, such as } in
									 {a 12}.

	Formatting Properties:

		InFirstParameterColumn - The cell is a member of the first column of the parameters table.
		InLastParameterColumn - The cell is a member of the last column of the parameters table.

		LeftSpaceOnNarrow - The cell should have an additional space on its left side, but only for the narrow
										prototype form.
		LeftSpaceOnWide - The cell should have an additional space on its left side, but only for the wide
									prototype form.
		RightSpaceOnNarrow - The cell should have an additional space on its right side, but only for the narrow
										 prototype form.
		RightSpaceOnWide - The cell should have an additional space on its right side, but only for the wide
									  prototype form.

		RightAlignOnNarrow - The cell should right aligned, but only for the narrow prototype form.
		RightAlignOnWide - The cell should be right aligned, but only for the wide prototype form.

		NegativeLeftSpaceOnWide - The first line of the cell can start one space to the left of where its normal
												 bounds would be, but only for the wide prototype form.

		FitIntoLeftIndentOnNarrow - The cell is overlaid on another cell with a left indent, and so should fit itself
												  into that width.
		FitIntoRightIndentOnNarrow - The cell is short enough to fit into an indent.

		</TSEntry>

	</#NDThemeSwitcherMenu>

----------

[ThemeName] is the ID of the theme with the string "Theme" appended, such as "DarkTheme" for "Dark".  So since it's
TSEntry_[ThemeName], the menu entry for "Dark" will have the CSS class "TSEntry_DarkTheme" applied.
