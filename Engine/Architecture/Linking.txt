_______________________________________________________________________________

Topic: Topic Symbols

	Every topic generates a symbol.  It represents it's fully resolved name in the code, so a topic "Function (int, int)" 
	appearing in "Namespace::Class" would conceptually have the symbol "Namespace::Class::Function (int, int)".  
	Conceptually, because in reality symbols are normalized and parameters are separate:
	
	- Member operators are replaced by a standard character, which we'll represent in this document with |, so the part 
		before the parentheses is actually "Namespace|Class|Function".  It would be the same for "Namespace.Class.Function".
	- Unnecessary whitespace is removed, which is usually any whitespace not in between two letters.
	- Parentheses appearing in the topic title are removed, normalized, and stored separately as the symbol's parameters.  In 
	  this case it would be converted to "int|int".
	- If no parentheses appear in the topic title and the topic has a prototype with typed parameters, those types become the 
	  symbol's parameters.  Something documented with "Function: FunctionName" that has a prototype of
	  "void FunctionName (int x, float y)" will have a generated parameter string "int|float".
		- Note that this means if you put your own parentheses in the topic title, they will override the prototype.  It's 
		  recommended that people not do this.
	- Case is preserved regardless of whether the underlying language is case sensitive.
	- Leading and trailing member operators are removed.  Multiple consecutive ones are condensed.

	Topics will also store the ID of the class they appear in, but note that the fully resolved symbol may go more than one
	level deeper than the class.  This is so if you define "File.txt" or "This vs. That" topics in "MyClass", the periods don't 
	cause Natural Docs to assume there's "MyClass.File" and "MyClass.This vs" classes.  In C# you can also use 
	"Interface.Function" to define a particular interface's function when a class implements multiple interfaces which use the
	same function name.  In all these cases the extra periods will still be converted in the symbol as if they represented nested
	classes, as it would be difficult to resolve links otherwise, but the topics are still associated with the class they appeared
	in.  This means the topic symbol will usually be a superstring of the class symbol, but you can't assume there's no
	member operators beyond it.  
	
	On a similar note there could also be "always global" topics associated with a class.  The symbol will be global but the
	topic will still have the ID of the class it appears in, and the symbol will not be a superstring of the class's symbol at all.

	The last section of the symbol sans parentheses is called the ending symbol, so for "Namespace::Class::Function (int, int)"
	it would be "Function".  These are converted to lowercase for case insensitivity and stored in an additional field to allow 
	links to look up every topic that uses a particular ending symbol in order to find possible matches regardless of case, scope, 
	or parameters.


Topic: Link Types

	There are three types of links that must be handled:

	Natural Docs Links - When someone writes "<Class.Member>" in a comment.
	Class Parent Links - When a class defines a parent, such as "class Child : ParentClass".
	Type Links - For linking types appearing in function and variable prototypes back to their definition.
 
	All three types of links depend on context to be resolved, such as what scope they're appearing in and what "using" 
	statements are in effect.  Yes, even class parent links as C# applies "using" statements to them.


Topic: Scoring Links

	Type and Class Parent Links:

	Type and Class Parent links are simpler as they are meant to be exact.  There are no plurals, possessives, "at" naming,
	or parameters to worry about.  When a new link needs to be resolved, it first generates a normalized symbol based on 
	the link text.  This is exactly the same process topic symbols go through, except these types of links won't have parethesis 
	to strip off.  A case insensitive ending symbol is also generated, and these two values are stored in the link's database
	record.
	
	The database is queried for all topics that use the ending symbol and match the language ID, as cross-language linking isn't
	appropriate here.  Each topic is given a numerical score based on many factors:
		
		- How good a match the scope is.  A link prefers to resolve to a topic in its own class before globals or topics found via 
		  "using" statements.  This is also used to weed out impossible matches.
		- Whether the case matches, depending on the language's case sensitivity setting.  Some languages are case sensitive,
		  some are not, and if it's not known then it will favor case sensitive matches but accept both.
		- Whether the topic type is appropriate for the link.  Type links need to go to type topics, and class parent links need to
		  go to classes.
		- Whether the topic has a prototype or body and how long.  This is used to distinguish between multiple definitions of
		  the same symbol, such as partial classes in C#.  Hopefully only one will be documented and that's the one we want to
		  link to.


	Natural Docs Links:

	There are multiple ways to interpret Natural Docs links, so the original link text is stored in the database.  We generate all
	the possible interpretations as needed rather than storing each possibility in the database.

	First, like topic symbols, the parentheses are separated off and normalized as the parameters.
	
	Next, the remaining text is searched for "at" keywords, which may result in multiple interpretations.  "X at Y" can be
	interpreted as a link named X that goes to Y, or as a link that goes to the literal symbol "X at Y".  Similarly, "X at Y at Z"
	can be "X" -> "Y at Z", or "X at Y" -> "Z", or the literal "X at Y at Z".

	For each interpretation, the target text is normalized as the symbol, and the ending segment of the symbol is converted into
	a case insensitive ending symbol.
	
	Next each ending symbol is checked for the possibility of being a plural and/or possessive form.  If so, additional interpretations 
	are generated to handle the singular forms and are stored in the database in <CodeDB.AlternateLinkEndingSymbols>.  They 
	may not all exist or make sense as they're just guesses.  For example, "leaves" can be translated into "leave", "leav", "leafe", 
	and "leaf" as the plural of all those words could be "leaves".  A more sophisticated analysis to try to weed out things like "leav" 
	isn't necessary as we can just rely on there being no targets defined for them.  All possible singular forms are also lowercase 
	for case insensitivity like the ending symbol.

	The database is queried for all topics that use the ending symbol or any of its possible singular forms.  Each topic is given a
	numerical score based on many factors:
		
		- Whether the topic matches the original ending symbol or a possible singular form.  Exact matches take precedence 
		  over generated singular forms.
		- How good a match the scope is.  A link prefers to resolve to a topic in its own class before globals or topics found via
		  "using" statements.  This is also used to weed out impossible matches.
		- Whether the topic is the same language as the topic the link is in.  Same language matches take precedence, but
		  cross-language links are allowed for Natural Docs links.
		- How good the parameter match is.  If someone writes "<Function()>" it prefers parameterless targets, whereas
		  "<Function(int,int)>" tries to find the best match possible.
		- Whether the case matches.  Case sensitive matches take precedence, but case insensitive matches are accepted
		  for Natural Docs links.
		- Whether the topic has a prototype or body and how long.  This is used to distinguish between multiple definitions of
		  the same symbol, such as partial classes in C#.  Hopefully only one will be documented and that's the one we want to
		  link to.


Topic: Resolving Links

	The best target for the link is chosen based on score and stored in the link's database record.  Links are identified by the 
	unique combination of normalized symbol, context, type, defining file ID, defining class ID, and language ID.  If two or more 
	links appearing in the code create the same combination of those elements they're considered the same link, but if even one 
	differs they're separate.  Why?

	- Links are used for resolving.
		- If two links appear in the exact same context with the exact same attributes, they will always resolve to the same 
			target and so storing them individually doesn't serve a purpose.
		- If two otherwise equivalent links have different cases, defining classes, or contexts they have the possibility of resolving
		  differently and must be handled individually.

	- Links are used for differential output building.
		- If a link's definition changes you need to know the class the link was defined in so that the output file for that class
			can be marked for rebuilding.
		- If a link's definition changes you also need to know the file that link was defined in so that the output file for that
			source file can be marked for rebuilding.  Thus two otherwise equivalent links that appear in two separate source files
			must be treated as two separate links.
		- Nothing requires links to be tracked per topic.  Tracking per class/file combination is sufficient and results in fewer
			links in the database.


Topic: Maintaining Links

	When a new link is created, it is resolved as described in <Resolving Links> and stored along with its definition in 
	<CodeDB.Links>.  For text links that have generated singular forms, those forms are stored in 
	<CodeDB.AlternateLinkEndingSymbols>.  This happens even if the link didn't resolve to anything.
	
	If a link is deleted it is simply removed from the database.  Since changes to the context results in a completely different link 
	as far as the database is concerned, adding or removing a "using" statement is handled by the old forms of the links being 
	treated as removed and the new forms being treated as new.

	If a topic changes, it is able to retrieve all links that could possibly resolve to it with <CodeDB.Links> and
	<CodeDB.AlternateLinkEndingSymbols>.  It can then generate its score for those links to see whether it serves as a better 
	target for any of them.  If so the link's target is updated and its file/class it's defined in are marked for rebuilding.

	If a topic is removed, it retrieves all links that have it as its target.  Those links are marked for reresolving and its file/class 
	marked for rebuilding.  The links are reresolved because it may resolve to a different target now instead of being undefined.

	If a topic is added, it retrieves all links that could possibly resolve to it and generates its score to see whether it serves as
	a better target for any of them.  If so the link's target is updated and its file/class are marked for rebuilding.  The fact that
	ending symbols are in the database for all links and their possible singular forms regardless of whether any topics exist for
	them means that a new topic will be able to find existing unresolved links that it could satisfy.
