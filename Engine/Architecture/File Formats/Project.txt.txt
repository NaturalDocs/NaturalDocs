_______________________________________________________________________________

The configuration file that defines the project settings for Natural Docs.  Various settings may be overridden by the command
line, though.

These files follows the standard conventions in <ConfigFile>.  Identifier whitespace is condensed.  Y, N, True, and False can 
be substituted for Yes and No.

	Topic: Project Information
		
		> Title: [title]
		> Subtitle: [subtitle]
		> Copyright: [copyright]

		The title, subtitle, and copyright notice for the project.  (C), (R), and (TM) will be converted into their respective symbols.
			
		> Timestamp: [timestamp code]
			
		The timestamp code is a regular string with the following subsitutions performed:
			
			m - Single digit month, when possible.  January is "1".
			mm - Always double digit month.  January is "01".
			mon - Short month word.  January is "Jan".
			month - Long month word.  January is "January".
			d - Single digit day, when possible.  1 is "1".
			dd - Always double digit day.  1 is "01".
			day - Day with text extension.  1 is "1st".
			yy - Double digit year.  2021 is "21".
			yyyy - Four digit year.  2021 is "2021".
			year - Four digit year.  2021 is "2021".
			
		Anything else is left literal in the output.  The substitution requires a non-letter on each side, so every m will not turn into
		the month.
			
		> Style: [name]
			
		The style to apply to all output targets.

		> Home Page: [file]

		The file that should serve as the home page.  This could be a source file in one of the input targets, or a HTML file in any
		location.  Relative paths are relative to the project folder.

		> Encoding: [name or number]
		> Encoding: [name or number] *.[extension]

		The character encoding source files use if it is something other than Unicode.  It can be specified as a name such as 
		"iso-8859-1" or a code page number such as "28591".

		The default is Unicode which will handle all forms of UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32.  You can set a new default for all files or 
		you can limit it to an extension such as "*.txt".  There can be multiple Encoding lines to cover all the extensions that need
		them.

 
	Topic: Source Folders

		> Source Folder: [path]
		> Source Folder [number]: [path]
		>    Name: [name]
				
		Specifies a source folder.  Relative paths are relative to the project folder.
			
		A number can optionally be specified.  If one is not, it uses the lowest number not in use by another source folder.  Each
		folder must have a unique number.
			
		Name can optionally be specified.  It's not required if there is only one source folder.  If there's more than one and it's 
		not specified it will be automatically generated.

		Overridden Properties:

			> Encoding: [name or number]
			> Encoding: [name or number] *.[extension]
			> Encoding: [name or number] [folder]
			> Encoding: [name or number] [folder]\*.[extension]

			Each source folder may add additional character encoding statements if desired.  These are applied in addition to the
			ones in <Project Information>.
			
			You can set a new default encoding for all files in this source folder, limit it to an extension such as "*.txt", limit it to a
			subfolder, or limit it to extensions in a subfolder.  Paths are relative to the source folder.  You can use multiple Encoding
			lines to cover all the subfolders and extensions that need them.


	Topic: Image Folders
			
		> Image Folder: [path]
		> Image Folder [number]: [path]
			
		Specifies an image folder.  Relative paths are relative to the project folder.
			
		A number can optionally be specified.  If one is not, it uses the lowest number not in use by another image folder.  Each
		folder must have a unique number.
			
 
	Topic: Filters
		
		> Ignore Source Folder: [path]
			
		Specifies a source folder that should not be scanned for files.  Relative paths are relative to the project folder.
			
		> Ignore Source Folder Pattern: [pattern]
			
		Specifies a pattern that should cause a source folder to be ignored if it matches.  ? matches a single character, * matches 
		zero or more characters.  It applies to the entire folder name, so "cli" will not match "client", although "cli*" will.
			
 
	Topic: HTML Output Folders
 
		> HTML Output Folder: [path]
			
		Specifies a HTML output folder.  Relative paths are relative to the project folder.
			
		Although internally output targets have numbers like input targets, they're not stored in this file because it's not important
		for them to remain consistent from one computer to the next.  They're only used for temporary data, whereas input target
		numbers affect the generated output file paths (/files2, etc.) and thus need to remain consistent so URLs don't constantly
		change.

		Overridden Properties:

			> Title: [title]
			> Subtitle: [subtitle]
			> Copyright: [copyright]
			> Timestamp: [timestamp code]
			> Style: [name]
			> Home Page: [file]

			Each output target may override Title, Subtitle, Copyright, Timestamp, Style, or Home Page properties if desired.  This 
			allows projects with multiple output targets to give each one its own style, subtitle, etc.
			
 
	Topic: Global Settings
 
		> Tab Width: [width]
			
		The number of spaces a tab should be expanded to.
			
		> Documented Only: [yes|no]
			
		Whether only documented code elements should appear in the output.
			
		> Auto Group: [yes|no]
			
		Whether automatic grouping should be applied.
