A binary file which stores the combined results of the two versions of <Languages.txt> as of the last run, as well as 
storing the IDs of each type so they maintain their consistency between runs.

		The file starts with the standard binary file header as managed by <BinaryFile>.

		> [[Language Attributes]]
		> ...
		> [String: null]
		
		The file then encodes each language by its name string, followed by its attributes, and repeats until it reaches a null
		string instead of a new name string.
		

		Language Attributes:

		> [Int32: ID]
		> [Byte: Type]
		> [String: Simple Identifier]
		> [Byte: Enum Values]
		> [Byte: Case Sensitive (1 or 0)]
		> [String: Member Operator Symbol]
		> [String: Line Extender Symbol]
		> [String: Line Comment Symbol] [] ... [String: null]
		> [String: Opening Block Comment Symbol] [String: Closing Block Comment Symbo] [] [] ... [String: null]
		> [String: Javadoc First Line Comment Symbol] [String: Javadoc Following Lines Comment Symbol] [] [] ... [String: null]
		> [String: Javadoc Opening Block Comment Symbol] [String: Javadoc Closing Block Comment Symbol] [] [] ... [String: null]
		> [String: XML Line Comment Symbol] [] ... [String: null]
		> [[Prototype Enders]]
		
		The attributes are self-explanitory.  The comment symbols repeat until a null string is reached.


		Prototype Enders:
		
		> [Int32: Comment Type ID]
		> [Byte: Include Line Breaks (1 or 0)]
		> [String: Prototype Ender Symbol] [] ... [String: null]
		> ...
		> [Int32: 0]
		
		Prototype ender sections repeat until a zero ID is reached.

		> [String: File Extension] [Int32: Language ID] [] [] ... [String: Null]
		> [String: Shebang String] [Int32: Language ID] [] [] ... [String: Null]
		
		Aliases, file extensions, and shebang strings are paired with language IDs.  All repeat until they hit a null string.

	Topic: 2.2

		- Removed Aliases from the language attributes.  They will be reflected in the later Alias list.
			- The file format documentation for 2.0 listed Aliases in both the language attributes and later in the Alias list, but only the
			  latter was implemented.  So this change is really just updating the documentation to match how it was actually implemented.
		- Removed the Ignored Extensions list.  They will be reflected by omissions from the Extensions list.

	Topic: 2.0
			
		- The file was introduced.
