	Topic: Header

		> [[Binary Header]]

		The file starts with the standard binary file header as managed by <CodeClear.NaturalDocs.Engine.BinaryFile>.


	Topic: Project Info

		> [String: Project Title or null]
		> [String: Project Subtitle or null]
		> [String: Project Copyright or null]
		> [String: Project Timestamp Code or null]
		> [String: Project Home Page Path (absolute) or null]

		The project info as of the last run.  If any of the properties were not set they will be null.

		Project Home Page is the setting applied by <Project.txt>, if any.  It is not the final computed home page that
		includes any specified by styles.


	Topic: Style Info

		> [String: Style Path]
		>    [String: Inherit] ... [String: null]
		>    [String: OnLoad] [String: OnLoad After Substitutions] [Byte: Page Type] ... [String: null]
		>    [String: Link] [Byte: Page Type] ... [String: null]
		>    [String: Home Page Path (absolute) or null]
		>
		> [String: Style Path]
		> ...
		> [String: null]

		Stores the list of styles that apply to this target in the order in which they must be loaded.  Each one starts as
		a path, which is either to the style's CSS file or <Style.txt>.  These are stored instead of the names so that if a
		name is interpreted differently from one run to the next it will be detected.

		The properties are a null-terminated list of inherit statements, then a null-terminated list of OnLoad statements
		each followed by a page type byte, then a null terminated list of Link statements each followed by a page type
		byte, then the path to the custom home page file or rull if it's not defined.  There will not be a page type byte
		following the null strings that end the OnLoad and Link lists.

		Stores all the <FileSource> IDs and what their numbers are.  This allows us to purge the related output folders if
		one is deleted or changes.
