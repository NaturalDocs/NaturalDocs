
Title: SQLite Library Customizations
_______________________________________________________________________________

These are the customizations applied to the SQLite library that is bundled with Natural Docs.


Group: Preprocessor Directives
_______________________________________________________________________________

These flags are added to the top of the sqlite3.c amalgamation before compilation.  They are documented at
https://www.sqlite.org/compile.html.


	Topic: SQLITE_DQS

		--- Prototype
		#define SQLITE_DQS 0
		---

		Setting this to zero disables support for double-quoted string literals, which has been deprecated since
		3.29.0 and the author recommends against using.  We don't use them and we don't want to ever rely on
		deprecated features.


	Topic: SQLITE_DEFAULT_MEMSTATUS

		--- Prototype
		#define SQLITE_DEFAULT_MEMSTATUS 0
		---

		Setting this to zero disables the sqlite3_status() interfaces that track memory and other memory usage
		tracking functions.  We don't expose these functions at all, and the documentation says omitting this
		makes memory allocation much faster and thus the entire library faster.


	Topic: SQLITE_LIKE_DOESNT_MATCH_BLOBS

		--- Prototype
		#define SQLITE_LIKE_DOESNT_MATCH_BLOBS
		---

		This makes LIKE always return false when applied to BLOBs, which simplifies and speeds up LIKE queries.
		We use LIKE but we don't use BLOBs, so this gets set.


	Topic: SQLITE_OMIT_DECLTYPE

		--- Prototype
		#define SQLITE_OMIT_DECLTYPE
		---

		This omits support for sqlite3_column_decltype() and _decltype16().  We don't expose these functions at
		all, and the documentation says omitting them allows prepared statements to use less memory.


	Topic: SQLITE_OMIT_DEPRECATED

		--- Prototype
		#define SQLITE_OMIT_DEPRECATED
		---

		Self-explanitory.  We don't want to ever rely on deprecated features and this will shrink the library size.


	Topic: SQLITE_OMIT_PROGRESS_CALLBACK

		--- Prototype
		#define SQLITE_OMIT_PROGRESS_CALLBACK
		---

		This omits support for sqlite3_progress_handler().  We don't expose this function at all, and the
		documentation says this will help SQL statements execute slightly faster.


	Topic: SQLITE_OMIT_SHARED_CACHE

		--- Prototype
		#define SQLITE_OMIT_SHARED_CACHE
		---

		This omits support for shared cache mode, which isn't enabled by default and the author recommends
		against using.  We don't use this mode and the documentation says omitting it can give a noticeable
		performance improvement.
