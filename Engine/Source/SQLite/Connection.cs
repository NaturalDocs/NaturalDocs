/*
 * Class: CodeClear.NaturalDocs.Engine.SQLite.Connection
 * ____________________________________________________________________________
 *
 * A class to provide access to a SQLite database connection.
 *
 *
 * Topic: Requirements
 *
 *		- The class must have access to NaturalDocs.Engine.SQLite.dll on Windows and libNaturalDocs.Engine.SQLite.so
 *		  on Linux.  Both must be compiled in multithreaded mode.
 *		- All threads must have their own connection, even if it's to the same database.  They cannot be shared.  One
 *		  thread can pass a connection to another, though.
 *		- Any <SQLite.Queries> and related objects have to be disposed of before disposing of the connection.
 *		- Any <SQLite.Queries> and related objects should only be used in the same thread as the connection.
 *
 *
 * Multithreading: Thread Safety Notes
 *
 *		The underlying database is thread safe, but Connection objects are not.  Each thread needs to have
 *		its own Connection object to access the database.
