/*
 * Class: CodeClear.NaturalDocs.Engine.CodeDB.Manager
 * ____________________________________________________________________________
 *
 * A class to manage information about various aspects of the code and its documentation.
 *
 *
 * Topic: Usage
 *
 *		- Register any change watching objects you desire with <AddChangeWatcher()>.
 *
 *		- Call <Engine.Instance.Start()> which will start this module.
 *
 *		- Call <GetAccessor()> or <GetPriorityAccessor()> to create objects which will be used to manipulate the database.
 *		  Each thread must have their own.
 *
 *		- The change watchers will receive notifications of any modifications the accessors perform.  They can be added and
 *		  removed while the module is running.
 *
 *		- Each <Accessor> must be disposed before disposing of the database manager.
 *
 *		- Disposing of the manager will automatically call <Cleanup()>, though if you have some idle time in which the
 *		  documentation is completely updated you may call it ahead of time.
 *
 *
 * Multithreading: Thread Safety Notes
 *
 *		> DatabaseLock -> ChangeWatchers
 *
 *		Externally, this class is thread safe so long as each thread uses its own <Accessor>.
 *
 *		For the <Accessor> implementation, all uses of the database connection must be managed by <DatabaseLock>.
 *		<UsedTopicIDs> and <UsedContextIDs> are only relevant when making changes to the database, so they are
 *		managed by <DatabaseLock> as well.
 *
 *		The change watchers, on the other hand, have their own lock since they may be accessed independently.  You may
 *		attempt to acquire the list with <LockChangeWatchers()> while holding <DatabaseLock>, but not vice versa.
 *
 *
 * Topic: Used IDs and Transactions
 *
 *		At the moment, ID tracking number sets such as <UsedTopicIDs> don't support transactions correctly.  If you were to
 *		add a topic to the database as part of a transaction and then roll it back instead of committing it, the IDs would still
 *		be marked as used.  This has the potential to eat up all the available IDs if a database is used over a long period of time
 *		without a full rebuild ever being performed.
 *
 *		This is not being fixed, however, because it's assumed that rolling back transactions never happens in Natural Docs as
 *		part of a normal path of execution.  Transactions are used mostly for performance and just as good practice in case
 *		this assumption should change in the future.  The only time it should occur is if the program crashes and it's triggered
 *		automatically.  However, in this case the database will be completely rebuilt on the next execution anyway so we don't
 *		need to worry about it.
