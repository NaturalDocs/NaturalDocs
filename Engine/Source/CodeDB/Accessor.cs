/*
 * Class: CodeClear.NaturalDocs.Engine.CodeDB.Accessor
 * ____________________________________________________________________________
 *
 * A class threads can use to access the code database.
 *
 *
 * Topic: Usage
 *
 *		- Retrieve this object from <CodeDB.Manager.GetAccessor()> or <CodeDB.Manager.GetPriorityAccessor()>.
 *
 *		- Use the <Lock Functions> and the <Topic Functions> to manipulate the database.
 *
 *
 * Multithreading: Thread Safety Notes
 *
 *		Each thread must have its own accessor.  One cannot be used by multiple threads at the same time.
 *
 *		Threads must acquire the appropriate locks using functions like <GetReadOnlyLock()> before calling data
 *		functions, and then release them afterwards with <ReleaseLock()>.  The only thing that's done automatically
 *		is upgrading a read/possible write lock to a read/write lock.  Otherwise, an exception will be thrown if you
 *		do not have the appropriate lock for a function.

		 * to believe, but it means we don't have to obsess over finding the ideal value.  The limit is set reasonably high in release
		 * builds because I'm still convinced there's some efficiency there, but not so high as to potentially overtax SQLite now or
		 * in the future.  In debug builds the limit is very low to test that everything works with multiple queries.
