/*
 * Class: CodeClear.NaturalDocs.Engine.CodeDB.ReferenceChangeCache
 * ____________________________________________________________________________
 *
 * A class that stores changes to reference counts in memory so they don't have to hit the database on
 * every operation.
 *
 * This class ignores all operations on ID zero.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *		- Create the cache.
 *
 *		- Every time a reference is added or deleted, call <AddReference()> or <RemoveReference()>.
 *
 *		- If you know the reference count stored in the database for an object that's likely to change, add it to the
 *		  cached information with <SetDatabaseReferenceCount()>.  This will lessen the database work when the cache
 *		  is flushed, but don't do this for references that might not change or you'll just be filling up memory with
 *		  unnecessary cache entries.
 *
 *		- When it's time to flush the cache...
 *
 *			- Use foreach to iterate through the <ReferenceChangeEntries>.
 *
 *			- Find the database reference count for any entries where it's unknown.
 *
 *			- Update the database.  Delete any records where the total reference count is now zero, and update
 *			  any other records where the count has changed.

		 * Why not just use System.Collections.Generic.SortedList?  Because then other code would have to iterate through
