/*
 * Class: CodeClear.NaturalDocs.Engine.CodeDB.Lock
 * ____________________________________________________________________________
 *
 * A struct to encapsulate the CodeDB database lock.
 *
 * The lock behaves somewhat similarly to a ReaderWriterLock, except that the two types of locks initially acquired
 * are ReadOnly and ReadPossibleWrite.  It is assumed that any thread that may need to write to the database will
 * also need to read from it first.  As such, it can share the database with other readers up until it actually starts
 * writing.  Also, it may end up not needing to write at all.  The only critical point is that nothing else can change
 * the database while it has a ReadPossibleWrite lock so the data that was read is still valid by the time an actual
 * write lock is acquired.
 *
 * The class also implements priority versions of both those locks.  This allows database access related to the
 * interface to jump ahead of any background threads that may also be using it.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This class assumes the code using it knows what it's doing.  It does not check to see if you're
 * releasing a lock you had, releasing the correct number of times, releasing the correct type of lock, etc.  This
 * logic is meant to be encapsulated in another class, so this one omits it for efficiency.
