 * Interface: CodeClear.NaturalDocs.Engine.CodeDB.IChangeWatcher
 * ____________________________________________________________________________
 *
 * An interface for any class that wants to watch for changes in the code database.
 *
 * Multithreading: Thread Safety Notes
 *
 *		This interface is used for receiving notifications when the database has changed.  As such, these functions can
 *		be called from any possible thread.  Make sure any structures you interact with are thread safe.
 *
 *		Because event handlers will be called while holding a database lock, you should keep interaction with other modules
 *		to a minimum to prevent deadlocks.  You don't want to access another thread-safe module causing your thread to
 *		wait for it to lock while another thread is holding that lock and waiting to access the database.  The event handler
 *		should ideally just collect the topic and class IDs for work that needs to be done and return, letting other code do
 *		the actual work later.
