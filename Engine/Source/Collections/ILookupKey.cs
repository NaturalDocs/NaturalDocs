/*
 * Interface: CodeClear.NaturalDocs.Engine.Collections.ILookupKey
 * ____________________________________________________________________________
 *
 * An interface for any class that needs to be indexed with a specific key that differs from what's returned by ToString().
 *
 * For example, <Symbols.ClassString>'s normal value is case sensitive but if its language is not it returns a lowercase
 * string for the key instead.  It doesn't use the lowercase key as the normal value because it wants to preserve the
 * case as entered for display.
