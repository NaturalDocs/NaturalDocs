	/* Enum: PrototypeParsingType
	 *
	 *		Null - Returned when the token is out of bounds or one of these values hasn't been assigned to it yet.
	 *
	 *
	 * Sections:
	 *
	 *		Sections are used to separate prototypes into blocks which are individually formatted.  For example, attributes in C# are
	 *		separated into their own sections so they appear on a separate line:
	 *
	 *		--- C#
	 *		[DllImport ("library.dll")]
	 *		extern static private bool LibraryFunction ();
	 *		---
	 *
	 *		StartOfPrototypeSection - The first token of a new prototype section.  It is possible for these to appear without
	 *											  corresponding <EndOfPrototypeSections>.
	 *		EndOfPrototypeSection - The last token of a prototype section, causing the next token to start a new one.  It is possible
	 *											for these to appear without corresponding <StartOfPrototypeSections>.
	 *
	 * Parameters:
	 *
	 *		StartOfParams - The start of a parameter list, such as an opening parenthesis.  It is possible for these to appear
	 *								without a corresponding <EndOfParams>.
	 *		EndOfParams - The end of a parameter list, such as a closing parenthesis.
	 *		ParamSeparator - A separator between parameters, such as a comma.
	 *
	 *		OpeningParamDecorator - A symbol at the beginning of a parameter, such as "{" in Tcl's "{a 12}".
	 *		ClosingParamDecorator - A symbol at the end of a parameter, such as "}" in Tcl's "{a 12}".
	 *
	 *
	 *	Types:
	 *
	 *		Type - The type excluding all modifiers and qualifiers, such as "int" in "unsigned int" or "Class" in "PkgA.PkgB.Class".
	 *		TypeModifier - A separate word modifying a type, such as "const" in "const int".
	 *		TypeQualifier - Everything prior to the ending word in a qualified type, such as "PkgA.PkgB." in "PkgA.PkgB.Class".
	 *		OpeningTypeModifier - An opening symbol modifying a type, such as "[" in "int[]" or "<" in "List<int>".  Can be followed
	 *										 by <OpeningExtensionSymbols> for multi-token symbols.
	 *		ClosingTypeModifier - A closing symbol modifying a type, such as "]" in "int[]" or ">" in "List<int>".  Can be followed by
	 *										<ClosingExtensionSymbols> for multi-token symbols.
	 *
	 *
	 *	Tuples:
	 *
	 *		Tuples are groups of types declared inline and used as a single type, essentially creating a struct without declaring it first.
	 *		In C# they look like this.  The members can be named or unnamed:
	 *
	 *		--- C#
	 *		public (string, int) varA;
	 *		public (string m, int n) varB;
	 *		---
	 *
	 *		They can also be nested:
	 *
	 *		--- C#
	 *		public (string, (int, float)) varC;
	 *		public (string m, (int i, float j) n) varD;
	 *		---
	 *
	 *		StartOfTuple - The start of a tuple, such as an opening parenthesis.  Can be followed by <OpeningExtensionSymbols> for
	 *							 multi-token symbols.
	 *		EndOfTuple - The end of a tuple, such as a closing parenthesis.  Can be followed by <ClosingExtensionSymbols> for
	 *							multi-token symbols.
	 *		TupleMemberSeparator - A separator between tuple members, such as a comma.
	 *		TupleMemberName - The name of a tuple member.
	 *
	 *
	 *	Names:
	 *
	 *		NameTypeSeparator - In languages that use them, the symbol separating a variable name from its type, such as ":" in
	 *										"x: int".  In languages that simply use a space this type won't appear.
	 *
	 *		Name - The name of the parameter or the code element being defined by the prototype.
	 *
	 *		KeywordName - The name of the code element being defined that is also a keyword, such as "operator" when overloading
	 *								operators or "get" and "set" when defining properties.
	 *
	 *
	 *	Parameter Modifiers:
	 *
	 *		Parameter modifiers are symbols that are part of the type but appear with the parameter name and only affect that parameter.
	 *		For example:
	 *
	 *		--- C++
	 *		int *x, y;
	 *		---
	 *
	 *		Here * is a parameter modifier, as the type of x is int* but the type of y is just int.
	 *
	 *		--- C++
	 *		int x[12], y;
	 *		---
	 *
	 *		Here [12] is a parameter modifier, as the type of x is int[12] but the type of y is just int.
	 *
	 *		ParamModifier - Any parameter modifiers.  These usually appear with the name but are part of the type, and aren't
	 *							    shared with other parameters inheriting the type, such as "*" in "int *x" in C++.
	 *		OpeningParamModifier - An opening symbol modifying a parameter.  These usually appear with the name but are part
	 *											of the type, such as "[" in "int x[5]".  Can be followed by <OpeningExtensionSymbols> for
	 *											multi-token symbols.
	 *		ClosingParamModifier - A closing symbol modifying a parameter.  These usually appear with the name but are part of
	 *										   the type, such as "]" in "int x[5]".  Can be followed by <ClosingExtensionSymbols> for
	 *										   multi-token symbols.
	 *
	 *
	 * Default Values:
	 *
	 *		DefaultValueSeparator - The symbol separating the name and type from its default value, such as "=" or ":=".
	 *		DefaultValue - The default value of the parameter.
	 *
	 *
	 *	Properties:
	 *
	 *		Properties are key/value pairs appearing in metadata, such as decorators in Python or annotations in Java:
	 *
	 *		--- Python
	 *		@decorator(arg1 = 12,
	 *		           arg2 = "text")
	 *		def DecoratedFunction ()
	 *		---
	 *
	 *		They're also used for attributes in SystemVerilog:
	 *
	 *		--- SystemVerilog
	 *		(* arg1 = 12,
	 *		   arg2 = "text" *)
	 *		module ModuleWithAttributes ()
	 *		---
	 *
	 *		Property names are marked with standard <Name> tags.
	 *
	 *		PropertyValueSeparator - The symbol separating a property name from its value, such as "=" or ":".
	 *		PropertyValue - The value of a property, such as "12" in "@RequestForEnhancement(id = 12)" in Java annotations.
	 *
	 *
	 *	Extension Symbols:
	 *
	 *		Some functions may need to skip blocks marked with opening and closing tokens like <OpeningTypeModifier> and
	 *		<ClosingTypeModifier>.  They would need to skip nested blocks as well.  This could be a problem when using unbalanced
	 *		symbol pairs like #( and ) since there would be two opening symbols and one closing one, leading the code to think there
	 *		was a nested modifier that wasn't closed.  If you use extension symbols it would be able to see that they are not two
	 *		separate opening symbols.
	 *
	 *		OpeningExtensionSymbol - Symbols following an opening symbol which are considered part of it, such as the asterisk in (*.
	 *		ClosingExtensionSymbol - Symbols following a closing symbol which are considered part of it, such as the closing parenthesis
	 *											   in *).
	 *
