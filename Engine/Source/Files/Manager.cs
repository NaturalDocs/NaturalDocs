/*
 * Class: CodeClear.NaturalDocs.Engine.Files.Manager
 * ____________________________________________________________________________
 *
 * A module which handles all the files Natural Docs scans.  In addition to source files, this includes image files that can be
 * referenced with "(see image.jpg)" and extras tied to CSS styles.
 *
 *
 * Topic: Usage
 *
 *		- Add file sources with <AddFileSource()>.  You can use <FileSources.Folder> or derive classes from <FileSource>.
 *		  <FileSource.Number> can be set or left at the default which will cause it to autogenerate.
 *
 *		- If desired, add filters with <AddFilter()>.
 *
 *		- Add any change watchers with <AddChangeWatcher()>.  This can be done before the module is started.
 *
 *		- Call <Engine.Instance.Start()> which will start this module. At this point the class is usable, but the file information
 *		  is as of the last run.
 *
 *		- Use <CreateAdderProcess()> to scan for added and changed files and to register them with the class.
 *
 *		- Call <DeleteFilesNotReAdded()> to mark everything not found by <Files.Adder> as deleted.
 *
 *		- Use <CreateChangeProcessor()> to process the changes.
 *
 *
 * Multithreading: Thread Safety Notes
 *
 *		Externally, this class is thread safe.
 *
 *		Internally, all variable accesses must use a monitor on <accessLock>.
