 * Interface: CodeClear.NaturalDocs.Engine.Output.HTML.SearchIndex.IChangeWatcher
 * ____________________________________________________________________________
 *
 * An interface for any class that wants to watch for changes in the search index.
 *
 * Multithreading: Thread Safety Notes
 *
 *		This interface is used for receiving notifications when the search index has changed.  As such, these functions can
 *		be called from any possible thread.  Make sure any structures you interact with are thread safe.
 *
 *		Because event handlers will be called while holding locks, you should keep interaction with other modules to a
 *		minimum to prevent deadlocks.  You don't want to access another thread-safe module causing your thread to wait
 *		for it to lock while another thread is holding that lock and waiting for one held here.  The event handler should
 *		ideally just collect the prefixes for work that needs to be done and return, letting other code do the actual work
 *		later.
