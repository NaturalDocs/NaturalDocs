	Topic: Header

		> [[Binary Header]]

		The file starts with the standard binary file header as managed by <CodeClear.NaturalDocs.Engine.BinaryFile>.


	Topic: Project Info

		> [String: Project Title or null]
		> [String: Project Subtitle or null]
		> [String: Project Copyright or null]
		> [String: Project Timestamp Code or null]
		> [String: Project Home Page Path (absolute) or null]

		The project info as of the last run.  If any of the properties were not set they will be null.

		Project Home Page is the setting applied by <Project.txt>, if any.  It is not the final computed home page that
		includes any specified by styles.


	Topic: Style Info

		> [String: Style Path]
		>    (properties)
		> ...
		> [String: null]


		Stores the list of styles that apply to this target in the order in which they must be loaded.  Each one starts as
		a path, which is either to the style's CSS file or <Style.txt>.  These are stored instead of the names so that if a
		name is interpreted differently from one run to the next it will be detected.


		Style Properties:

			> [String: Style Path]
			>
			>    [String: Inherit]
			>    ...
			>    [String: null]
			>
			>    [String: OnLoad]
			>       [String: OnLoad After Substitutions]
			>       [Byte: Page Type]
			>       ...
			>    [String: null]
			>
			>    [String: Link]
			>       [Byte: Page Type]
			>    ...
			>    [String: null]
			>
			>    [String: Home Page Path (absolute) or null]

			The properties are a null-terminated list of inherit statements, then a null-terminated list of OnLoad statements
			each followed by a page type byte, then a null terminated list of Link statements each followed by a page type
			byte, then the path to the custom home page file or rull if it's not defined.  There will not be a page type byte
			following the null strings that end the OnLoad and Link lists.


	Topic: File Source Info

		> [Int32: Source FileSource Number]
		>    (properties)
		> ...
		> [Int32: 0]
		>
		> [Int32: Image FileSource Number]
		>    (properties)
		> ...
		> [Int32: 0]

		Stores all the <FileSource> IDs and their properties.  This allows us to purge or rebuild the related output folders if
		one is deleted or changes.


		Source File Source Properties:

			> [Int32: Source FileSource Number]
			>    [String: Source FileSource UniqueIDString]
			>    [String: Source FileSource Name]
			>    [String: Repository Name]
			>    [String: Repository Project URL]
			>    [String: Repository Source URL Template]

			The unique ID string allows us to identify the file source from one run to the next, even if its number changes.

			The source URL template will contain substitution characters as documented in
			<CodeClear.NaturalDocs.Engine.Config.RepositorySubstitutions>.  The repository branch name isn't stored because
			it should be reflected in the source URL template.


		Image File Source Properties:

			> [Int32: Image FileSource Number]
			>    [String: Image FileSource UniqueIDString]

			The unique ID string allows us to identify the file source from one run to the next, even if its number changes.
