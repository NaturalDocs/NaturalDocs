/*
 * Struct: CodeClear.NaturalDocs.Engine.AbsolutePath
 * ____________________________________________________________________________
 *
 * A struct encapsulating a file path string which must be absolute.  This is a subset of the <Path> struct
 * which only contains the functionality relevant to absolute paths.  It's good for code clarity and safety to
 * use this instead of <Path> when the value must be absolute.
 *
 * See <Path> for more details on why these structs are used at all.
